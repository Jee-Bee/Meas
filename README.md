# Meas

Meas is a test project to learn coding and understand more of the basics of measurement and acoustics.
Most of mine info is based on some papers i found on internet.

# installing
The all files are build using Python 3.4 <. Python 2.7.xx is not supported.
Also it is not tested on linux. OSX had some issues(thought with Sounddevice) and Windows is unknown.
For installing there are some other packages needed:
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
* Sounddevice
* Qt5 (optional)

# status
This project don't had any updates for some time... this due other priorities. 
I hope somehow in the near future i can start developing again.
Also if somebody have better understanding of what i'm trying to archieve you are free to help (read explaining).
If you have better programming tricks. you are free to help (please explain too).
